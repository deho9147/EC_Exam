# EC_Exam
This is a quick examination of how assigning EC votes based on percentage of the vote earned in each state may affect the outcome of the election.

This is viewable on my website at dholland.site/ec_exam

The python code will not result in the exact same CSVs as I fixed some problems manually.

I used Qgis to create the maps.
